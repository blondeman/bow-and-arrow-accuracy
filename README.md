## Team: Bow and Arrow Accuracy!
* Dominik David

## Premise
In this project we will be looking into how aim assist impacts the accuracy of a user shooting a bow and arrow in virtual reality. A core aspect of video games is teaching the player to interact with its mechanics. This is typically done through tutorials showing you how to use certain mechanics, but can be hidden in a way to make the player feel as though they have taught themselves. This project will be testing if the aim of players using a bow and arrow improves faster with an aim assist, or if trial and error is a better approach.
